# BalooSqliteToXattr
Export Baloo SQLite database to extended file attributes of corresponding files.
If you are using KDE (https://www.kde.org) and Baloo (https://community.kde.org/Baloo) for indexing your files and because of some weird stuff Baloo doesn't use XAttr instead of SQLite files, you can use this simple program to export SQLite database to xattr of corresponding files.
